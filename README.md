# CheckBipartialGraph_AI_

## About The Project
This code will check if the graph is bipartial or not. A bipartite graph, also called a bigraph, is a set of graph vertices decomposed into two disjoint sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent.

## Getting Started
just do followings:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mbhesam/CheckBipartialGraph_AI_.git
pip install networkx
pip install matplotlib
python3 bipartial_show.py
```
## Usage 
you can set any graph as *.edgelist file and in that you have to set neighbour of each node exactly like files in this repository.
add name of your file in file_name varriable and run project.

enjoy it :)
